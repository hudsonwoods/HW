<p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/1-20150114180226.jpg"></p><p>Two integral elements of the Hudson Woods interior are the custom built <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/kitchen-pantry" target="_blank">kitchen pantry</a> and kitchen island. Designed by the <a href="http://langarchitecture.com/" target="_blank">Lang Architecture</a> team and built by a local maker, the pieces work together to harmonize the great room. </p><p>The soapstone countertop extends from the kitchen pantry over to the kitchen island which also utilizes locally sourced solid black walnut for the drawer system. Wood for the island comes from the same tree, as much as possible and the drawer fronts are made from the same board to ensure grain continuity. The drawer system is built with dividers, an integrated knife block and customizable peg system in the large drawer. </p><p>Drawers are designed to provide ample amount of flexible storage with both enclosed and open spaces while adding seating and extending the kitchen into the great room. The island provides a focal point and gathering place around one of the most enjoyable rooms in a house - the kitchen. </p><p>The soapstone top and blackened steel base add to the complexity and aesthetic depth of the home, creating a contrast to the natural white oak tones. Soapstone is non-porous so it doesn't absorb moisture and is highly resistant to staining. When ordered together, the kitchen island and kitchen pantry soapstone is cut from the same slab and hand selected for the ideal veining and visual characteristics of each piece.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/2-20150114180244.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/3-20150114180253.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/4-20150114180303.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/Rehder-3.png"></p><p><br></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/Render-1.png"></p><p><br></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/Render-2.png"><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/Render-4.png"></p>
