<p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/ThingLink1-20150211152337.jpg"></p><p>We are excited to announce the release of seven new land parcels comprising over (30) acres in Hudson Woods. Now in "phase three," the project is advancing at a very fast pace. Ten homes have been sold and construction is active this winter. Lots currently available range in price from $765,000 - $815,000. Our landscape team is carefully preparing these sites to bring out their natural characteristics, creating mountain views and open meadows, preserving dense woods, small creeks and legacy hiking trails. For a closer look at these lots, explore our interactive <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/availability" target="_blank">availability map</a>.</p><p>The ten Hudson Woods buyers have chosen a variety of base home <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/homes" target="_blank">materials</a> and a bevy of <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/upgrades" target="_blank">upgrades</a> that will give each home a bespoke sensibility. Several homes will have the exterior cedar wood stained black for a dramatic look. Some of the homes follow a "right-side-up" floor plan with entry on the lower level. This layout has floor to ceiling windows in the great room which wrap around the corner for extended wide open views, a larger deck that extends outdoor living space, and en suite bathrooms for each of the three bedrooms.</p><p>Many buyers thus far are installing the gunite pool with bluestone patio and dry laid walls, and some buyers are opting to build accessory buildings such as our pool house and guest house. For the interiors, our local maker partners are busy crafting the firm's custom designed <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/custom-built-kitchen-island" target="_blank">kitchen islands</a> and our custom <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/kitchen-pantry" target="_blank">kitchen pantries</a>. We've had a great time exploring the winter landscape at Hudson Woods this season with buyers, maker partners, friends, our families and all the visitors we've had this season. As winter rolls along we're already looking forward to Spring and all that lies ahead for Hudson Woods.</p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/1-20150209181651.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/3-20150209182831.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/1-20150210162439.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/Stocksy_txp06c00a25jIJ000_Small_186690.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/2-20150210162255.jpg"></p><p>Winter scenery photographs, clockwise from top right, courtesy: Bri Stachowski/AndNorth; Dierdre Malfatto/Stocksy; via @escapebklyn; Bri Stachowski/AndNorth; @theyellownote; @Meagancampstyle; @andnorth (2); @thusfarrell; @catskilltracks; via @escapebklyn<br></p>
