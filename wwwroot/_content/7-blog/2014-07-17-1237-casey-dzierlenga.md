Scrolling through the website you’ll encounter some of the friendly beasts Casey and husband Sam Moyer have met while adventuring through the Hudson; including a barn vulture and Hoss the Horse.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/BARN-VULTURE.jpg"></p><p>You may remember that we’ve mentioned Casey in a post about <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/from-the-source-samuel-moyer-furniture/">Samuel Moyer Furniture</a>. A husband and wife duo, they moved from Los Angeles to the serene Hudson Valley in pursuit of a more authentic life. In their new home, an old farmhouse they’ve been meticulously restoring, Casey and Sam have been exploring activities you’d be hard pressed to find in LA or NYC. They have taken to such things as bee keeping and making smoked maple syrup from local trees (no plans to bottle it just yet).</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/HUDSON-VALLEY-LIGHT-1024x764.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/HOSS-1024x692.jpg"></p><p>Of course, the maple trees in the area are amongst Casey’s favorite breeds but the Black Walnut is far and away her favorite. It’s a tree that the Hudson Valley is known for and Casey uses often in her work. Both Sam and Casey use found objects and mill from the plethora of fallen trees offered up by the area.</p><p>One of Casey’s most popular, a hand-carved tree swing, comes from local white oak, fitting well with the material selection at Hudson Woods. It can be found hanging in the great room at the model home. You’ll also find Casey’s Austfonna Rocking Chair and Utility Benches. The benches are made using utilitarian building techniques from the shaker tradition in Casey’s favorite Black Walnut.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/swing.jpg"></p><p>“I really appreciate how many local makers are being featured in the model house,” says Casey. “There’s a real community of makers out here and it’s great to be a part of that high caliber work.”  In fact at Hudson Woods, we’ve experienced first hand how tightly nit this community is.
