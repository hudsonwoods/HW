<p>As many of you know, we hosted an&nbsp;Autumn gathering this past weekend at Hudson Woods with some of our friends from the Hudson Valley including Arrowood Farms, Huckle & Goose and Ravenwood.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14px;">If you couldn't make it or even if you did, we'd like to share a video&nbsp;developed by our friend Tara Sgroi that captured the evenings festivities quite beautifully. Watch the video&nbsp;above. Of course, the food was also&nbsp;phenomenal so we asked Ravenwood and Huckle & Goose for a couple of their recipes. See&nbsp;the recipes below. Enjoy!</span></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/1-20141022170644.jpg" style="font-size: 14.4444446563721px;"><br><em style="background-color: initial;">Chris & Dana of Ravenwood</em></p><p><span><a href="http://ravenwoodny.com" target="_blank">Ravenwood</a> is an old 4-acre cow pasture in Olivebridge, NY which was bought by chef, food stylist and grower Chris Lanier and his wife Dana McClure who is a visual artist and designer. Together, they undertook the challenge of turning the place into a farm which gave birth to a series of dinner parties hosted in Brooklyn and upstate showcasing produce from the farm.</span></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/4-20141022164457.jpg"><br><em>Left:&nbsp;Anca & sister&nbsp;Andrea of Huckle & Goose&nbsp;</em></p><p>Started by sisters-in-law Anca Toderic and Christine Lucaciu,&nbsp;<a href="https://hucklegoose.com" target="_blank">Huckle & Goose</a> prepares a curated sampling of seasonal meals and recipes to which people can subscribe and have delivered to their home every week. Each week, the ingredients and recipes are based around what’s in season at your local farmers’ market.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/3-20141022164544.jpg"><br><em>Left: Huckle & Goose | Right: Arrowood Farms</em></p><p><a href="http://www.arrowoodfarms.com" target="_blank">Arrowood Farms</a> crafted a custom brown Ale for Hudson Woods to fit the flavor of our Autumn gathering. For the brown ale they blended American Cascade hops along with English Fuggle hops; in addition to crystal, black and chocolate malts. Cascade adds a bold, floral and citrus aroma while the Fuggle brings fruity, spicy and woody undertones. Located in the Rondout Valley Arrowood is a one acre hops field with seven different varieties. While they will be supplying naturally grown hops for home brewers, nano breweries and micro breweries, as part of their research they will be experimenting with their own farm brewed ales and lagers.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.kingstonwine.com" target="_blank">Kingston Wine Co.</a> provided the fantastic wine choices for the evening;&nbsp;2 inexpensive but delicious organic wines that reflect their philosophy of&nbsp;supporting&nbsp;farmers who work hard to enrich and preserve their land for future generations.&nbsp;Their wine making&nbsp;philosophy revolves around&nbsp;5 distinctive&nbsp;tiers; Agriculture, Historic Normalcy, Context,&nbsp;Collaboration and Beauty. &nbsp;And of course, our own Brittain Stone mixed the&nbsp;Mississippi Bourbon Punch.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/Instagram-photos-20141022182009.jpg"></p><p><a href="http://kaufmann-mercantile.com" target="_blank">Kaufmann Mercantile</a> was also kind enough to provide a canvas field tent in which&nbsp;they actually camped the night of the event. Their cast iron fire bowl and fire-side leather camp stools&nbsp;also provided the perfect backdrop for&nbsp;s'mores&nbsp;and drinks. They even outfitted the chefs and staff with Shinola aprons.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/2-20141022170737.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/5-20141022170749.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/7-20141022170806.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/6-Feature-20141022170815.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/8-20141022171013.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/9-20141022171019.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/10-20141022171044.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/11-20141022171054.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/12-20141022171108.jpg"></p><p><br>-- &nbsp;Recipes Below...</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/Squash.jpg"></p><p><b style="background-color: initial;">Ravenwood's&nbsp;Roasted Winter Squash with Crispy Sage</b></p><p>4 people<br><br>2 delicata squash<br>4 T butter<br>4 T honey<br>5 cloves garlic<br>15 sage leaves<br>1/4 cup canola oil<br>5 T olive oil<br>Salt, Pepper</p><p>1) Cut delicata squash in half lengthways, scoop out seeds, do not peel<br>2) Slice into half moons 1/4 inch thick, set aside<br>3) Thinly slice garlic, set aside<br>4) Heat canola oil in small shallow sauté pan until 325 degrees<br>5) Test 1 sage leaf in the oil.
