<p>The tour around&nbsp;Lake Minnewaska is not only very beautiful, but it's also quite manageable at 1.7 miles. Directly off the main parking lot in Minnewaska State Park, the well attended, but not overcrowded trails are open,&nbsp;airy and provide a&nbsp;moment of scenic bliss.</p><p><a href="http://nysparks.com/parks/127/details.aspx" target="_blank">nysparks.com/parks/127/details.aspx</a></p>
