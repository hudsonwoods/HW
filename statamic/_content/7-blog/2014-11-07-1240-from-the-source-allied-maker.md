<p><img src="/assets/img/journal/Lead.jpg"></p><p>You may remember in previous posts we've discussed lighting in the model house by&nbsp;<a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/from-the-source-workstead" target="_blank">Workstead</a> &&nbsp;<a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/materiadesigns" target="_blank">Materia Designs</a>. This week, we'd like to take a look at lighting fixtures from another New York based&nbsp;studio in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alliedmaker.com/" target="_blank">Allied Maker</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Located in Glen Cove, NY, Allied Maker is a&nbsp;contemporary lighting design studio founded by Ryden Rizzo.&nbsp;Started as an artful woodworking practice, it has organically evolved into a multi-disciplinary studio which&nbsp;collaborates&nbsp;with local artisans and manufacturers; as well as handcrafting and assembling products in-house.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Their approach to&nbsp;design stems from an obsession with raw materials. From the way a&nbsp;material sounds to its tactile&nbsp;properties&nbsp;to the aesthetic qualities of the finished product, every detail is important and contributes to the beauty of the&nbsp;piece.&nbsp;</span>With an&nbsp;influence on&nbsp;geometric simplicity, serious craftsmanship, and high-quality materials we felt an immediate kinship to the sensibilities of Hudson Woods. Allied Maker's&nbsp;focus on working with local partners further sparked the relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The model house features four&nbsp;light fixtures from Allied Maker, each custom&nbsp;made to order. Below, is the Half-Dome Pendant&nbsp;which hangs in the dining area above a&nbsp;<a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/from-the-source-sawkille-co-2" target="_blank">Sawkille dining table & chairs</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/2-20141107181311.jpg"></p><p>Below is the dome pendant which hangs in the master bedroom. The dome pendants are handcrafted from premium 16-gauge heavy weight metal and individually pushed over a wooden mold to form the&nbsp;shape. The dome is then meticulously brushed and waxed to achieve the perfect sheen.</p><p>The blown glass globe of the below dome pendant&nbsp;provides pleasant surface diffusion while complimenting the light's overall form. The fixture is finished with a premium-grade American Black Walnut canopy that is turned on a lathe and finished with natural oils.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/3-20141107181443.jpg"></p><p>The Brass and Oak Bell Pendant hangs at the Entry Hall of the house.&nbsp;Referencing a classic hand bell, this petite and minimalist pendant houses rich textures of solid brass, white oak, and cotton cord.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/1-20141107181546.jpg"></p><p>The T-Pendant hangs both in the children's room as seen below and in&nbsp;the guest bedroom.&nbsp;A solid brass two-globe ceiling fixture with porcelain sockets, it&nbsp;is modeled after 19th century gas lanterns that were used to illuminate saloons.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/5-20141107181601.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/4-20141107181631.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/9-20141107181649.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/8-20141107181701.jpg"></p>
