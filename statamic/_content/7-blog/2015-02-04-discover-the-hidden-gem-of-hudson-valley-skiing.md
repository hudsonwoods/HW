But just adjacent Hunter in Tannersville, is a less well known but quite spectacular cross country ski park called <a href="http://www.mtntrails.com/home.html" target="_blank">Mountain Trails XC Ski Center</a>. Set among 300 heavily wooded acres traversed by former logging trails, the facility has been lovingly preserved, maintained and improved by the Hyer Family since they purchased the property in 1978. We spoke with the Hyers to shed some more light.</p><p>Rosemary and Mark Hyer were avid skiers in the 60's at Hunter Mountain in its early days. She was on the ski patrol, and he was a teacher at Hunter elementary who also coached the high school alpine racing team. They purchased a house on this magnificent property that happens to abut the town of Tannersville via a side road pasture. "We wanted to do something with the property where we weren't going to overly develop it… and didn't want to disrupt the land much because it's really nice forest up there." Deciding to open up the logging trails to cross country skiers, "was a way to keep the land the way it was."</p><p>Since then with their three sons and a daughter participating in the business, they have opened more natural forest pathways and built a lodge that offers full service sales and rentals so that all can now access over 22 miles of 2 track trails for classic Nordic skiing and a growing number of skating lanes (for skate style Nordic). "Our grooming is really superior. We have just a really experienced team… it takes years of understanding different types of snow, the temperature and when to (groom)." There are trails for every skill level, and for the uninitiated, fear not, since the National Ski Patrol is always on hand to monitor the trails.</p><p>The Hyers say that what's most unique about center is the woodsy setting. "It's a different feel up here. You go into the area and step out with your skis, and you really feel like you're in the middle of the forest." This has earned them core group of long time customers and visits from avid Nordic skiers from all over the northeast. "They seem to like it because of the nature of our trail system and because our elevation is quite high, so the snow is usually better here." And of course after one conquers the trails, they remind us, "Tannersville's a great town."</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/photo-00020-20150205104050.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/photo-00031.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/1-20150205125921.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/2-20150205130057.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/Trail-Map.jpg"></p><p><br>Our friends at the <a href="http://styleofsport.com/snow-day/" target="_blank">Style of Sport</a> blog have also selected some choice items for the cross country skier woman and at <a href="http://www.rockandsnow.com/store/">Rock &amp; Snow</a> in New Paltz, men have these excellent options.</p><p>FISCHER MYSTIQUE MY STYLE CROSS COUNTRY SKIS. <br>Designed for the fitness-oriented woman and ideal for groomed tracks, these skis have Wide Body Technology for enhanced stability and climbing performance.</p><p>FISCHER MY STYLE XC TOURING CROSS COUNTRY SKI BOOTS.<br>Paired with the skis, these My Style Cross-Country Ski Boots are a great choice for recreational in-track skiing with extra insulation to protect against the cold</p><p>THE NORTH FACE WOMEN'S THERMOBALL VEST.<br>A signature North Face piece in shimmery silver.
