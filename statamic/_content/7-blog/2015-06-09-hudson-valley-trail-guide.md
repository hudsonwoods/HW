Directly off the main parking lot in Minnewaska State Park, the well attended, but not overcrowded trails are open, airy and provide a moment of scenic bliss.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/1-20150610111819.png"></p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony_Kill_Falls" target="_blank"><strong>Stony Kill Falls</strong></a>: 13.3 Miles From Hudson Woods<br>Within a relatively brief walk in a portion of the Minnewaska Park, near Wawarsing is a stunning 90 foot waterfall flowing over a sheer cliff face into a pristine swimming hole. Above the fall is a pool from which there are marvelous views of the Stony Creek and Roundout Valleys, into Sullivan County.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/1-20150610112012.png"></p><p><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/watershed_protection/ashokan.shtml" target="_blank"><strong>Ashokan Reservoir</strong></a>: 11.0 Miles From Hudson Woods<br>We've said it before and we'll say it again. The Ashokan Reservoir is one of the neatest spots in the Hudson Valley. Stunning mountain views surround a serene and historic lake built in 1915 to provide water to New York City. To this day, the reservoir provides 40% of New York City's daily water usage.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/10208452875_28a7d82d9b_b-20150610112238.jpg"></p><p><a href="http://www.wvrta.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Rosendale Trestle</strong></a>: 16.9 Miles From Hudson Woods<br>The most impressive stage along the 24 mile long Walkill Valley Rail Trail, this refurbished train truss bridge that crosses over the Rondout Creek dating back to 1872. Peer over Rosendale, and while you're there, marvel that rail trail now extending continuously from Gardiner to Kingston.</p>
