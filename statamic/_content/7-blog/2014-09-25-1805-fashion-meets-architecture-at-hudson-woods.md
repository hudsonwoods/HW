	As some of you may know, we had the pleasure of hosting Chronogram recently for their annual fall fashion photo shoot. One of our first forays into fashion, it was a great opportunity to welcome fashion&nbsp;from&nbsp;local designers to Hudson Woods, including items by de Marchin in Hudson, Living Eden in Red Hook, Gwenno James in Beacon, and hats from Katie Burley, also in Beacon.</p><p>"I wanted to photograph the Chronogram magazine spread at Hudson Woods because I had read about it in the local press touting environmentally friendly building practices featuring local artisans work," remarked photographer&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kellymerchant.com/" style="background-color: initial;">Kelly Merchant</a>. We're excited to continue&nbsp;highlighting local artisans and hope that&nbsp;Hudson Woods can serve as a unique point of inspiration for the creative&nbsp;community across disciplines, from architecture to furniture to fashion to photography.</p><p>Brian Mahoney, Editorial Director at the Chronogram added, "One of the reasons we chose the site was it's modernist-meets-rustic appeal, incorporating a high design concept into a rural setting using natural materials. For Chronogram readers, this informs life in the Hudson Valley, where we have access to world-class culture in all forms while being surrounded by some of the most beautiful terrain in the world."</p><p>Below, two of our local maker partners are featured in Kelly's photos. On the&nbsp;left,&nbsp;a&nbsp;bench made from found wood by <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/from-the-source-samuel-moyer-furniture">Samuel Moyer</a> and on the&nbsp;right, a credenza in the downstairs den,&nbsp;made by <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/from-the-source-furniture-from-fern">Fern Handcrafted</a>.</p><p>

"The home is proof that you can be environmentally conscious without sacrificing quality. The attention to detail was thoughtful throughout from conception to design and decor."</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/HWoods-(614).jpg"></p><p>A few behind the scenes photos below&nbsp;we&nbsp;captured during the shoot.</p><p>
