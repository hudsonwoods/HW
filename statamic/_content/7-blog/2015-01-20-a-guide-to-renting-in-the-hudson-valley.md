<p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/Rental 3a-20150122160746.jpg"></p><p>Since we launched this past summer many people have inquired about renting at Hudson Woods but since we aren't currently renting out the model house, we wanted to provide some insights about the rental market in our area both for homeowners and those looking for short term getaways.</p><p>There has long been a concise but consistent pocket of repeat seasonal and weekend renting in our neck of the Hudson Valley. Now the market is evolving rapidly. As "short term rental" facilitators (think Home Away, AirBnB, Red Cottage, and most recently, <a href="http://www.onefinestay.com/" target="_blank">onefinestay</a>) become more predominant it's easier for full-time homeowners and second homeowners to list their properties for weekend, monthly and even seasonal rentals. </p><p>"Renters have a strong need to get away from city stimulation and seek only the sounds of crickets and peepers and the light of the moon and fireflies," says Helen Coyle Bergstein, owner of <a href="http://www.nestrealtyco.com/" target="_blank">Nest Realty</a>. </p><p>A pool is quite important for the full summer season, and her clients love swimming holes like Vernooy Kill Falls or Awosting Lake. The early weeks of Fall are very busy, as are Thanksgiving and December holidays. In the winter, the proximity to Belleayre, Windham and Hunter ski areas are the draw, and renters look for a home with a wood burning stove and (throw back!) a hot tub.</p><p>She estimates a typical summer rental with a pool in the area is in the $25,000 range. In other seasons, rates are in the $450 per night for 6 people. "Seasonal renters are usually more than one family. It's likely that they'll want it every year."</p><p>Just in the last two years, the Hudson Valley has seen a boom of short term rentals because "the internet is ramping up," says realtor Eric Bean, "and I've seen a couple higher end rentals start to pop up." Often while showing potential buyers high end properties, "we do have a (rental) conversation, and over 90% of the time it's 'is the place AirBnB-able and what is the rate?'"</p><p>He notes that his clients whose taste in decor and furnishing is a "little more sophisticated," have great success with New York renters. "It has to do with how it looks. For a New York buyer, the country cabin is 'cute', but when they see something glossy, they tend to gravitate towards that." Eric is optimistic about the burgeoning market and how it will encourage more high-end properties to open up their doors to visitors. </p><p>Perhaps there's no greater proof of the area's appeal than <a href="http://www.onefinestay.com/hudson-valley/vacation-rentals/" target="_blank">onefinestay</a>'s recent beta launch of their vacation home "portfolio" in the Hudson Valley. The London based hospitality service looks for properties with space, character and comfort and whose owners have interesting personalities.
