<p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/SWING-ERIN-1-940x520-20150312172952.jpg"></p><p>This week we are fortunate to have the peripatetic duo Erin and Denny of the addictive blog (and Instagram feed) Escape Brooklyn write about some of the most notable hotels and inns in our neck of the Hudson Valley. These two have been traveling nearly every weekend for years and have managed to turn their musings into something of a second career, also making them welcome guests at all the most desirable spots within a day trip from Crown Heights. Browse their suggestions below and give them a follow at #escapebklyn.</p><p>--</p><p>When Hudson Woods asked us to write a piece on our favorite new hotels in the Hudson Valley/Catskills, a mental list began to take form and we had trouble narrowing it down… The truth is, there are many worthy resorts, AirBNB's and boutique hotels that are deserving of recognition. To narrow it down, we began thinking about the hotel experience as a whole and realized that our very favorite places had more than one "dimension" to them–they all had bars, restaurants or breweries or some other social aspect attached. We figured this was a great criteria for tourists, locals or frequent travelers–like us! Without further ado, here's our top 5 list of places to visit–and not necessarily stay–in the Hudson Valley and Catskills.<br><br></p><p><b>Spruceton Inn:</b><br>Smack-dab in the middle of nowhere lies this picturesque 9-room throwback "bed and bar" motel. Rooms are cozy, modern, with incredible mountain views in the morning. Go for a hike at nearby Diamond Notch Falls or West Kill Mountain, then stop at their bar, Conan's Corner for a post-hike beer. Innkeepers Casey and Steven have a beautiful property with bonfires, grills, and horseshoe games spread throughout. Beer lovers will be excited to know that West Kill Brewery<http:></http:> will be breaking ground just down the road as soon as it warms up. Fingers crossed it will be open this fall!</p><p>More information: <a href="http://www.sprucetoninn.com/">http://www.sprucetoninn.com/</a></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/OUTSIDE-LOOKING-DOWN-940x520.jpg"><br></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/CHECK-IN-WITH-MAP.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/OUTSIDE-FROM-AFAR-WITH-FLOWERS-940x520-20150312134904.jpg"></p><p><br><b>The Stewart House:</b><br>In Athens, NY, one of the oldest continuing restaurants and inns in the Hudson Valley was built in 1883. Owner Owen Lipstein just finished major renovations after being forced to gut much of the structure following Hurricane Irene. Their nine bright, airy rooms are all remarkable in their own way, many of them overlooking the Hudson River. But that's not all–it also has a restaurant and bar on the bottom floor. Come to check out the local bands that play here or have dinner in a romantic setting in their dining room.</p><p>More information: <a href="http://www.stewarthouse.com/">http://www.stewarthouse.com/</a></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/restuarant-at-night.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/room-stewart.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/stewart-common-space.jpg"></p><p><br><b>The Graham &amp; Co.</b><br>A subject of nearly every design magazine out there, this notoriously hard to book motel helped put the Catskills back on the map. The pool, nightly bonfires, and camaraderie that can only be created by sleeping in their bunkhouse make the Graham and Co. a top destination for stylish New Yorkers. Though weekends are almost fully booked for the summer, weekday availability abounds, so book soon for summer! General Manager James Anthony (who is also the curator for the Phoenicia Flea<http:></http:>) can guide you to all the local hot-spots including their neighboring restaurant, the delicious (and beautiful!) Tavern 214<http:></http:>.</p><p>More information: <a href="http://www.thegrahamandco.com/">http://www.thegrahamandco.com/</a></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/graham-sign-940x520.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/new-room-940x520.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/graham-pool-940x520.jpg"></p><p><a href="http://www.thegrahamandco.com/"></a><br><b>Deer Mountain Inn</b><br>The ultimate dream-lodge, filled with taxidermy, antiques and giant fireplaces off the backroads in Tannersville. Nestled on 170+ wooded acres, the inn has private trails great for hiking, biking, or visiting their private swimming holes. The bottom floor of the inn houses the fantastic restaurant where chef Marc Rosenberg cooks up some of the best fare in the Catskills. Order up a cocktail and cozy up to the bar fireplace in during the cold months, or enjoy their fabulous mountain-view outdoor patio during warm weather. As far as we're concerned, there's not a better place to hole up for an entire weekend.</p><p>More information: <a href="http://deermountaininn.com/">http://deermountaininn.com/</a></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/deer-mountain-entrance-940x520.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/whole-room-erin-tub-940x520.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/restaurant-chandeliers-940x520.jpg"></p><p><br><b>Foxfire Mountain House</b><br>The actual hotel isn't open yet, but owners Tim and Eliza have us really, really excited for summer. What is slated to be a 10 room hotel, restaurant and bar, couldn't have a more picturesque setting or a better power-couple behind it. It's no wonder that the location is the site of so many photoshoots–the grounds not only have the hotel, but also a large lilly pond, and our favorite rental cottage ever. The multiple fireplaces, full kitchen, 2 person bath, and patio with a grill make this an ideal place to unwind, explore or hunker down for a weekend.<br></p><p>More information: <a href="http://foxfiremountainhouse.com/">http://foxfiremountainhouse.com/</a></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/FF-INTERIOR-LOBBY-940x520.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/FF-INTERIOR-LOVELY-940x520.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/resized/FF-BEDROOM-3-940x520.jpg"></p>
