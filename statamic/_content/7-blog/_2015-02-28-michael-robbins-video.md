<p>This week wanted to share the beautiful video from our friend and one of our maker partners, Michael Robbins. As you may know, we have two of Michael's pieces at Hudson Woods; the Big Bend Chair and Wickson Chair. Having gone to art school and studied photography, Michael's perspective on craftsmanship is an interesting one. He views woodworking as a medium for exploring the visual world. In the video Michael gives cerebral insights into the process of a maker, how he started and where he draws inspiration. </p>
