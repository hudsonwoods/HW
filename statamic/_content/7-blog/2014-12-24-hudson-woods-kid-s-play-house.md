<p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/PH1.jpg"></p><p>A couple of weeks ago, we took a look at the <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/hudson-woods-tree-house" target="_blank">tree house</a> upgrade, one of the Hudson Woods <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/upgrades" target="_blank">upgrades</a> that captures the spirit of childhood and nostalgia. Another item available at Hudson Woods that aims to better connect children to nature and the outdoors and ignite their imagination is our playhouse design. </p><p>Similar to the tree house, the play house is divided into three levels, every level inspiring different activity. Each area is enclosed but flows into the outdoors with exterior cladding constructed of locally-sourced black locust wood. The playhouse comes outfitted with barn door entry, climbing rope and operable shutters creating a true space of their own for children. </p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/PH3.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/PH2.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/PH5.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/PH6.png"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/PH7.png"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/PH8.png"></p>
