<p><br>It is safe to say that we had a blast this past weekend at the first&nbsp;Field + Supply Maker Fair in High Falls, NY. The exhibiting makers and designers&nbsp;had stunning displays of work. It was a fantastic experience to see the burgeoning creative community of the Hudson Valley collected in one location with the Black Barn as a perfect setting. And Hudson Woods served as a nice extension to the fair, just a 15 minute drive from the Black Barn,&nbsp;people were able to stop by and see many of the maker's pieces in a home&nbsp;setting. If you missed the fair, all you need to do is search #fieldandsupply on instagram and you'll get 320+ photos recapping&nbsp;the event. We'd like to share some of our favorites to get you started.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://hudsonwoods.com/assets/img/journal/2c.jpg"></p><p>Lots of folks enjoying the festivities | Photo from @dollyandmilky</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/2-20141016140306.jpg"></p><p>Looking out over the fire pit | Photo&nbsp;from @NalataNalata</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/2b.jpg"></p><p>Everyone brought their dogs to Field + Supply | Photo from @Remodelista</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/2d.jpg"></p><p>Photo from @Delonis</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/3a-20141016140416.jpg"></p><p>Sawkille had an incredible display | Photo from @meagancampstyle</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/3b.jpg"></p><p>Photo from @sawkillecomapny</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/3c.jpg"></p><p>And stools by our friends from Materia Designs | Photo from @Remodelista&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/3d.jpg"></p><p>Pieces by Michael Robbins Furniture&nbsp;| Photo from @_michael_robbins</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/3e.jpg"></p><p>Great photo from our friends @andnorth</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/3f.jpg"></p><p>Ravenwood also featured a farm stand | Photo from @ravenwoodny</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/3g.jpg"></p><p>A&nbsp;look at our table styled by @meagancampstyle</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/4-20141016140555.jpg"></p><p>And of course,&nbsp;the man who organized the fair @bradforddesigntherapy</p>
