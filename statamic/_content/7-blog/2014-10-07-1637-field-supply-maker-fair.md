The barn sits at the edge of a field and we will have several merchants in the barn and then over a dozen tents on the field with close to two dozen other merchants and a few food vendors including The Kitchenette which makes the best homemade desserts!"</p><p>
	<img src="/assets/img/journal/1-20141008103924.jpg"></p><p>Brad grew up in a small town in Arkansas where he&nbsp;always looked forward to the annual Arts and Crafts fair. "I loved the experience of being surrounded by so many creative people and seeing their latest designs,&nbsp;it was very social.&nbsp;I wanted to combine the idea of where I came from with where I am now as an interior designer,&nbsp;creating&nbsp;a similar experience to the fairs I have such fond memories."</p><p>Brad also&nbsp;has&nbsp;a weekend house in Accord, NY, not far from Hudson Woods.&nbsp;"There is so much nuance in the area. The landscapes and vistas are absolutely beautiful, especially during the fall.&nbsp;In addition, there's a significant number of craftspeople here who I believe are taking craftsmanship to another level.&nbsp;I was excited to bring in Hudson Woods because of their shared appreciation and enthusiasm for a more modern point of view in the Hudson Valley."</p><p>
