<p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/hum_grossingersresort_hudsonwoods.jpg"></p><p>Bungalow colonies, Borsht Belt resorts and our country's comedic legacy meet NY's most exciting new culinary destination and burgeoning second home market, at the 92Y's upcoming program, "The Lure of the Catskills: Then and Now."</p><p>Hudson Woods is proud to be a part of this highly anticipated May 13th event that will celebrate the evolving lifestyle of the Hudson River Valley region and include conversations with the Grossinger Family (Bunny and Elaine, former co-owners of Grossinger's Resort Hotel, and Elaine's son Mitchell Grossinger Etess, CEO of Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority); Emma Tuccillo, Founder of <a href="http://www.andnorth.com/" target="_blank">And North</a>, one of our most favorite chroniclers of all things Catskills. NBC Talk Stoop's Cat Greenleaf (a self-proclaimed Catskills junkie) will MC the evening. Comedian Stewie Stone, a Borscht Belt favorite who many documentary fans are sure to remember from the 2013 "When Jews Were Funny," will be our opening act. Other special guests will be announced soon.</p><p>If scintillating talk and stand-up aren't enough to keep you entertained…well, then, come for the food! At least a dozen "tastes" of the Catskills will be on hand serving their delicious fares, including <a href="http://www.cowbella.com/" target="_blank">Cowbella</a>, <a href="http://www.dirtygirlfarmny.com/" target="_blank">Dirty Girl Farm</a>, <a href="http://www.tastefruition.com/" target="_blank">Fruition Chocolate</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RelishHudson" target="_blank">Relish Hudson</a>, <a href="http://www.greenanefarms.com/" target="_blank">Greenane Farms</a>, <a href="http://www.breadalone.com/" target="_blank">Bread Alone</a>, <a href="http://www.amystakeaway.com/" target="_blank">Amy's Take-Away</a> and <a href="http://heather-ridge-farm.com/bees-knees-cafe/" target="_blank">Bees Knees Café</a>.
