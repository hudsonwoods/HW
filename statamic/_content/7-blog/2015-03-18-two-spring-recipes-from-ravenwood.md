To celebrate we wanted to follow up on our  <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/3-recipes-to-get-through-a-winter-storm" target="_blank">winter recipe</a> post from January by bringing you two Spring recipes based on local ingredients. We reached out to one of our local culinary friends, Ravenwood, located a stone skip away from Hudson Woods in Olivebridge, NY. </p><p><a href="http://ravenwoodny.com/" target="_blank">Ravenwood</a> is a collaboration between Chris Lanier and Dana McClure on a 4-acre cow pasture which they bought in 2010 with hopes of turning the place into a small vegetable farm. Seeking creative ways to integrate their work, life and community between Brooklyn and Upstate New York, they started hosting intimate dinners showcasing produce and small-batch products made on the farm. As Ravenwood has grown over the years, Chris and Dana have worked on a number of projects and gatherings, including our <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/1035-autumn-gathering-at-hudson-woods" target="_blank">Autumn gathering</a>, last year. Now they are renovating a 19th Century barn on their property to serve as the Ravenwood outpost.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/2-Ravenwood-20150313111328.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/1-Ravenwood.jpg"></p><p>Without further ado, here are two Spring recipes from Ravewood that you can make at home.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/Salad.jpg"></p><p><strong>Spring greens and herb salad</strong></p><p>Serves 1.
