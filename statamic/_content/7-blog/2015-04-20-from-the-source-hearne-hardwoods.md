  <p>In past posts we've discussed many of the places where we source construction and finishing materials, from <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/1826-from-the-source-white-oak-from-the-hickman-family" target="_blank">White Oak</a> used throughout the homes to <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/1715-from-the-source-sun-valley-bronze" target="_blank">sand cast bronze</a> details on doors. This week, our friend and local woodworker, <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/1858-from-the-source-samuel-moyer-furniture" target="_blank">Sam Moyer</a>, turned our attention to Hearne Hardwoods after visiting their facilities on a sourcing trip. Sam has gotten to know the family run operation quite intimately over the years, sourcing much of the wood he uses from Hearne.</p>

This week, our friend and local woodworker, <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/1858-from-the-source-samuel-moyer-furniture" target="_blank">Sam Moyer</a>, turned our attention to Hearne Hardwoods after visiting their facilities on a sourcing trip. Sam has gotten to know the family run operation quite intimately over the years, sourcing much of the wood he uses from Hearne. </p><p>Founded in 1981 by Rick Hearne with a focus on offering a wide range of fine hardwood species, <a href="http://www.hearnehardwoods.com/" target="_blank">Hearne Hardwoods</a> has grown to maintain over 140 types of domestic and imported wood including Birdseye Maple instead of Hard Maple, Amboyna Burl, book matched 40"+ Paduak, Koa, Rosewood, Snakewood and French Walnu. It certainly is an impressive collection and it's all done with ethical harvesting practices as a the lead priority. </p><p>Hearne sources from areas of the world where sound forest management is in place. They sell a lot of state certified sustainable products such as German Spessart Oak and deal in many salvaged woods such as reclaimed American Chestnut. Trees are a magnificent renewable resource when managed properly and handled with the right considerations at mind for local habitats and communities. </p><p>For Hudson Woods, Sam sources the Black Walnut used to construct our <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/kitchen-pantry" target="_blank">kitchen pantry</a>. Three pantries are already under construction and of course the fourth is standing at the model house. Hearne has been a valuable resource for Sam through the process. Sam also purchases a majority of his live-edge material from Hearne along with whatever else he can pick up when he visits the facility. </p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/9-20150422151003.jpg"></p><p>Above: Hudson Woods pantry made with Black Walnut sourced from Hearne Hardwoods. </p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/english_walnut.jpg"></p><p>Above: A giant English Walnut log being prepared for cutting with a 67" bandsaw. </p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/8-20150422145333.jpg"></p><p>At left above: An English White Oak log with beefsteak mushrooms.
