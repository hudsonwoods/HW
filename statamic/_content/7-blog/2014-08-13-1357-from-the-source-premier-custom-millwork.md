<p><img src="/assets/img/journal/1-20140813153542.jpg"></p><p>This week we’d like to highlight some of the detail elements of the model home at Hudson Woods made by New York craftsman Jesse Schmitt and his company <a href="http://www.premiercustommillwork.com/">Premier Custom Millwork.</a></p><p>Jesse has always lived in and enjoyed the inspiration provided by scenic wooded settings. When Hudson  Woods came calling, it was a natural fit for him. The Premier Custom Millwork shop is nicely  nestled on a quiet 3 acre wooded lot located in the hills of Varysburg,  NY.</p><p><a href="http://www.premiercustommillwork.com/"></a></p><p>With a focus on providing wood products acquired from local suppliers Jesse believes in hand selecting raw hardwoods and transforming them into a vision. At Hudson Woods that vision translated into selecting the right trim for all of the windows and exterior doors which are made from solid Mahogany. The window designs called for custom sizing so each window was assembled individually in his workshop including double pane glass installation and delivered to the Hudson Woods as a complete piece, ready to install.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/2-20140813153559.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/4-20140813153643.jpg"></p><p>Jesse and his crew outfitted the entire house with the Mahogany trim and  custom made  the exterior mahogany doors, including the Dutch door  pictured above. The Mahogany promises to weather quite beautifully and  we're excited to see the result in coming years.</p><p>Premier Custom Millwork also collaborated with our friends at <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/from-the-source-white-oak-from-the-hickman-family" target="_blank">Hickman Lumber Co.</a> to ethically source White Oak pieces to construct the staircase and interior doors. Premier also created several other custom elements such as the nook desktop and live edge bench in the entry hall.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/5-20140813153657.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/6-20140813153711.jpg"></p>
