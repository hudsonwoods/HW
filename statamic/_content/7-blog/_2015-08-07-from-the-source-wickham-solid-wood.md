This is only appropriate as it comes from centuries of ingrained tradition studied by Jessica Wickham in Japan for over 5 years. "In Japan there is an immense reverence for wood, unlike anything in the United States. It goes back to Buddhism and spiritual beliefs."</p><p>This kind of spiritual connection to the items that surround us is built into today's consciousness in Japan. It brings people closer to natural surroundings where materials are sourced, developing a deeper and more conscientious relationship with the world. A lot of wood in Japan is actually sourced from American hardwoods such as walnut, white oak, cherry," says Jessica.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/2-20150807185120.png"></p><p>Jessica started her career in the corporate world, moving to Japan after college to work in technology. To "stay sane" she started studying Japanese hand tools and craftsmanship. After much traveling and visiting local craft people around Japan she became deeply attune with to the art of woodworking. Bringing her knowledge stateside, Jessica set up shop in the Hudson Valley where her family often vacationed during her childhood. It is an ideal environment to hone the serene qualities of the art.</p><p>With a rich bevy of beautiful woods in the area including Walnut, White Oak, Black Cherry, White Ash and Red Elm amongst others, the Hudson Valley provides all the resources needed without having to harvest or cut down living trees. Wickham's studio only uses salvaged wood within driving distance of their shop.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/3-20150807185129.jpg"><br></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/4-20150807185149.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/5-20150807185157.jpg"><br></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/6-20150807185205.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/7-20150807185212.png"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/20140719_HudsonWoods-47.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/resized/8A2A0473 (1).jpg"></p>
