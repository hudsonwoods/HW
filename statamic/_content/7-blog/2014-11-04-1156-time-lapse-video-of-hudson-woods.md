<p>We're excited to share with you a time lapse showing the construction process of the model home. Construction started in October of 2013 and took us through last year's harsh winter days. This video captures 9 months from ground breaking to our summer launch party.&nbsp;Typical construction spans approximately 6-9 months and we have 3 more homes currently under construction with two breaking ground soon. It's promising to be a busy winter!&nbsp;Stay tuned for more videos including a time lapse of the model home showcasing the seasonal changes of the Hudson Valley.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also&nbsp;learn more about the building materials from some of our blog posts including&nbsp;<a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/from-the-source-white-oak-from-the-hickman-family" target="_blank">Hickman Lumber</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/from-the-source-premier-custom-millwork" target="_blank">Premier Custom Millwork</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/from-the-source-sun-valley-bronze" target="_blank">Sun Valley Bronze</a>.&nbsp;</p>
