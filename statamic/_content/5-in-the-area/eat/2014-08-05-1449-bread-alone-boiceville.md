<p>This Bread Alone location&nbsp;is perfect before or after&nbsp;a&nbsp;jaunt through the Ashokan Reservoir. It carries almost all of the organic grain products,&nbsp;and the kitchen cooks a mean brunch. Coming soon, they will&nbsp;host&nbsp;a farmer's market Friday afternoons.</p><p><a href="http://www.breadalone.com/boiceville" target="_blank">breadalone.com/boiceville</a></p>
