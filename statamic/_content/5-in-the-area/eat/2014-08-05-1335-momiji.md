<p>Who knew you could get pretty darn good sushi in Stone Ridge? Momiji has all the Japanese staples in the non-sushi zone,&nbsp;and remarkably fresh fish. Kids love&nbsp;the cool Ramune&nbsp;bubble sodas.</p><p><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/momiji-restaurant-stone-ridge" target="_blank">momijius.com</a></p>
