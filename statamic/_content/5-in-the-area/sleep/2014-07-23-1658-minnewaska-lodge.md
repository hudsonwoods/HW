<p>This&nbsp;hotel earns the word "lodge"&mdash;Tall ceilings, huge windows, lots of wood, an&nbsp;outdoor fire pit and adirondack chairs. The huge back yard abuts the intimidating cliffs of the Shawangunk Ridge and the surrounding 22,000 acres of state preserve. You practically fall out of bed onto a hiking trail.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.minnewaskalodge.com/">minnewaskalodge.com</a></p>
